X Wallpaper is a popular choice for many homeowners looking to add a personal touch to their décor. But how is wallpaper made?
Wallpaper is created by first printing the design onto paper. Once the design is printed, it is then coated with a thin layer of vinyl.

These strips are then pasted onto the wall using a special adhesive.</p><p>Wallpaper can be made from a variety of materials, including fabric, paper, and even metal.
