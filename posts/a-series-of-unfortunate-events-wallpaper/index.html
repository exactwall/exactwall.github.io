After you&rsquo;ve gathered all the materials you need, the next step is to start making your wallpaper.
To make sure your design is perfectly aligned, use a level to draw lines horizontally and vertically across the wall. Next, apply adhesive to the back of your first strip of wallpaper using a roller. Be sure to spread an even layer of adhesive from top to bottom. Once the adhesive is applied, position the strip on the wall and press it into place.
Use a utility knife to trim any excess wallpaper from the edges of the wall. Repeat this process with each subsequent strip of wallpaper until the entire area is covered.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://exactwall.github.io/tags/wallpaper-photos-images/>wallpaper photos images</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://exactwall.github.io/posts/710-wallpaper/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>710 Wallpaper - 640x1136 Background Hd Wallpaper 725</span></a>
