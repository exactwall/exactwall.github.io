In the world of wallpaper, this means designs that are free of busy patterns and unnecessary embellishments.
Minimalist wallpaper first gained popularity in the 1970s as part of the wider minimalism movement in the arts. This new style was a reaction against the excesses of previous decades, and minimalism&rsquo;s emphasis on simplicity and functionality resonated with many people. Minimalist wallpaper continued to be popular in the 1980s and 1990s, as more homeowners sought out clean, modern looks for their homes.</p><h2 id=beige-rivets-wallpaper-with-white-wainscoting--transitional--dining>Beige Rivets Wallpaper With White Wainscoting – Transitional – Dining<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#beige-rivets-wallpaper-with-white-wainscoting--transitional--dining>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://i.pinimg.com/736x/6b/cf/87/6bcf874f30b90292e603a078a86176bc.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.g2aHa2eob8MO_8qN2H-jqwHaKV&pid=15.1"' alt="Beige Rivets Wallpaper with White Wainscoting – Transitional – Dining"><p><em>Source: pinterest.com</em></p><blockquote><p>wainscoting decorpad grasscloth rivets.</p></blockquote><ol><li>What is basketball wallpaper?
