After you&rsquo;ve gathered all the materials you need, the next step is to start making your wallpaper.
To make sure your design is perfectly aligned, use a level to draw lines horizontally and vertically across the wall. Next, apply adhesive to the back of your first strip of wallpaper using a roller. Be sure to spread an even layer of adhesive from top to bottom. Once the adhesive is applied, position the strip on the wall and press it into place.
Use a utility knife to trim any excess wallpaper from the edges of the wall. Repeat this process with each subsequent strip of wallpaper until the entire area is covered.</p><h2 id=beach-party-pictures-images-and-stock-photos---istock>Beach Party Pictures, Images And Stock Photos - IStock<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#beach-party-pictures-images-and-stock-photos---istock>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src="http://media.istockphoto.com/photos/people-celebration-beach-party-summer-holiday-vacation-concept-picture-id478722954?k=6&m=478722954&s=612x612&w=0&h=ka2OINqimys9x4CeoOFV5QIfLM6g7eKFd20yrUDe23w=" onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.UkY44OqHGLOQw2EgGeLoLAHaFC&pid=15.1"' alt="Beach Party Pictures, Images and Stock Photos - iStock"><p><em>Source: istockphoto.com</em></p><blockquote><p>beach summer celebration holiday vacation concept parties event shitty holidays usa bands boats boogie events tired liability ready water sunset.</p></blockquote><p>The idea of a &lsquo;grey wallpaper&rsquo; has been around for years, but it&rsquo;s only recently that people have started to take it seriously.
