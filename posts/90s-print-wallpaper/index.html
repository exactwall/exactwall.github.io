The Yellow Wallpaper is a short story written by Charlotte Perkins Gilman. The story is about a woman who is suffering from post-partum depression and is prescribed &ldquo;the rest cure&rdquo; by her husband. The woman becomes obsessed with the wallpaper in her room and eventually goes insane.
Gilman wrote The Yellow Wallpaper as a response to the Victorian era&rsquo;s treatment of women&rsquo;s mental health. She was prescribed the rest cure when she was suffering from post-partum depression and it made her condition worse. Gilman wanted to raise awareness about the dangers of this treatment and show that it was not effective.</p><h2 id=seamless-background-90s-stock-vector-illustration-of-retro---63869264>Seamless Background 90s Stock Vector.
