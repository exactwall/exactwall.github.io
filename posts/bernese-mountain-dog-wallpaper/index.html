War wallpaper is a type of wallpaper that became popular in the early nineteenth century. It is usually a dark color with military or patriotic scenes printed on it. Early war wallpapers were often hand-painted and expensive. They were often used to line the walls of homes of wealthy families or government officials. In the mid-nineteenth century, mass production of war wallpaper became possible, making it more affordable and available to the general public. By the early twentieth century, war wallpaper was used in both private homes and public spaces such as offices and schools. It remains popular today as a way to show support for one&rsquo;s country or as a decorative element in a room.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://exactwall.github.io/tags/wallpaper-photos-images/>wallpaper photos images</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://exactwall.github.io/posts/asobi-asobase-wallpaper/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Asobi Asobase Wallpaper : Asobi Asobase</span></a>
