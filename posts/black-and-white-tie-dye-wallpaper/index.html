There are many different themes present in &ldquo;The Yellow Wallpaper&rdquo; by Charlotte Perkins Gilman. One theme is that of mental illness and its effects. The narrator is clearly suffering from some sort of mental breakdown, and the story provides a look into how her condition affects her relationships and her view of the world. Another theme is that of sexism and the treatment of women. The narrator&rsquo;s husband is constantly telling her what to do and what not to do, and she is not allowed to pursue any interests of her own. This ultimately leads to her mental breakdown.</p><h2 id=red-and-black-windows-10-theme---themepackme>Red And Black Windows 10 Theme - Themepack.me<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#red-and-black-windows-10-theme---themepackme>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://themepack.me/i/c/749x468/media/g/1052/red-and-black-theme-yi17.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.5s03uFt-KhA8n_fe-aS41wHaEo&pid=15.1"' alt="Red And Black Windows 10 Theme - themepack.me"><p><em>Source: themepack.me</em></p><blockquote><p>theme wallpapers desktop backgrounds venom background computer windows abstract 1920 pattern.</p></blockquote><p>Benefits of Wallpaper: Helps create a atmosphere, Adds personality to a room, Can add warmth or coldness to a room.
