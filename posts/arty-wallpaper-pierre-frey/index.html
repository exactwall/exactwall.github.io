Texture Wallpaper- What to Look for
When choosing wallpaper, there are a few key things to consider. First and foremost, the texture should be something that works with the décor of your room. For example, if you have a rustic bedroom with wooden furniture, go for a wood grain wallpaper. If you have a more modern bedroom with sleek furniture, choose a textured wallpaper like suede or marble. Secondly, make sure the texture is large enough so that it doesn&rsquo;t look pixelated or chopped up when viewed from a distance. And finally, be sure to factor in how often you&rsquo;ll be changing your wallpaper. A weekly change will give your walls an extra dose of life while monthly changes will keep them looking fresh.
There are many different textures out there to choose from so feel free to experiment!</p><h2 id=pin-by-designs-by-katrina-on-wallcoverings--pierre-frey-wallpaper-frey>Pin By Designs By Katrina On Wallcoverings | Pierre Frey, Wallpaper, Frey<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#pin-by-designs-by-katrina-on-wallcoverings--pierre-frey-wallpaper-frey>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://i.pinimg.com/originals/95/62/d4/9562d4be060635affd8a4602800c474d.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.PViebseweVIn1qG-VcMUwwHaIK&pid=15.1"' alt="Pin by Designs by Katrina on Wallcoverings | Pierre frey, Wallpaper, Frey"><p><em>Source: pinterest.com</em></p><blockquote><p>frey.</p></blockquote><p>If you&rsquo;re looking for something to spruce up your walls, heart wallpaper is a great option.

But aside from being a stylish addition to your home, did you know that wallpaper also has some great benefits? For starters, wallpaper can help insulate your home.
