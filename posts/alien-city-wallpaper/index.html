Wallpaper has been around for centuries, but it wasn&rsquo;t until the late 20th century that minimalist wallpaper became popular. The term &ldquo;minimalist&rdquo; refers to a style of art and design that is characterized by simple, clean lines and a focus on function over form. In the world of wallpaper, this means designs that are free of busy patterns and unnecessary embellishments.
Minimalist wallpaper first gained popularity in the 1970s as part of the wider minimalism movement in the arts. This new style was a reaction against the excesses of previous decades, and minimalism&rsquo;s emphasis on simplicity and functionality resonated with many people. Minimalist wallpaper continued to be popular in the 1980s and 1990s, as more homeowners sought out clean, modern looks for their homes.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://exactwall.github.io/tags/wallpaper-photos-images/>wallpaper photos images</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://exactwall.github.io/posts/albedo-wallpaper-genshin/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>Albedo Wallpaper Genshin - Paimon Genshin</span></a>
