In 1867, English author Charlotte Perkins Gilman wrote “The Yellow Wallpaper,” a short story about a woman who is slowly driven insane by the yellow wallpaper in her bedroom. The story is a feminist critique of the treatment of women during the Victorian era. In the story, the protagonist’s husband, a doctor, forbids her from doing anything that might excite her, including reading and writing. He believes that if she rests and takes care of her health, she will be cured of her “nervous condition.” However, the protagonist becomes increasingly obsessed with the wallpaper in her room, which she believes is hiding a figure that is trying to escape. The story concludes with the protagonist tearing off the wallpaper and crawling into a hole behind it. Gilman’s story was inspired by her own experience with postpartum depression.\n82nd Airborne Wallpaper - WallpaperSafari Source: wallpapersafari.com\nairborne 82nd paratrooper 82d.\nAIR ASSAULT WINGS: FIX BULLWINKLE!

The term &ldquo;kawaii&rdquo; was first used in the 1970s to describe Japanese comic books and animation that were aimed at children. At this time, many children in Japan were wearing colorful clothing inspired by these works, which gave rise to the Japanese expression &ldquo;kawaii ga suki,&rdquo; meaning &ldquo;I like it cute.&rdquo; Kawaii became popularized outside of Japan during the 1990s when people began using it as a way to describe things that are visually pleasing or charming.</p><h2 id=82nd-airborne-tribute--my-father-was-a-member-of-the-82-air--flickr>82nd Airborne Tribute | My Father Was A Member Of The 82 Air… | Flickr<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#82nd-airborne-tribute--my-father-was-a-member-of-the-82-air--flickr>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://c2.staticflickr.com/6/5210/5280579781_687b34338b_b.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse4.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.TMulnKjerPHWPIvB8-gtQAHaJj&pid=15.1"' alt="82nd Airborne Tribute | My father was a member of the 82 Air… | Flickr"><p><em>Source: flickr.com</em></p><blockquote><p>airborne 82nd paratrooper lmnelsonscorner.</p></blockquote><p>If you&rsquo;re a basketball fan, then you need to check out this basketball wallpaper!

In 1867, English author Charlotte Perkins Gilman wrote &ldquo;The Yellow Wallpaper,&rdquo; a short story about a woman who is slowly driven insane by the yellow wallpaper in her bedroom. The story is a feminist critique of the treatment of women during the Victorian era. In the story, the protagonist&rsquo;s husband, a doctor, forbids her from doing anything that might excite her, including reading and writing. He believes that if she rests and takes care of her health, she will be cured of her &ldquo;nervous condition.&rdquo; However, the protagonist becomes increasingly obsessed with the wallpaper in her room, which she believes is hiding a figure that is trying to escape. The story concludes with the protagonist tearing off the wallpaper and crawling into a hole behind it.
Gilman&rsquo;s story was inspired by her own experience with postpartum depression.</p><h2 id=82nd-airborne-wallpaper---wallpapersafari>82nd Airborne Wallpaper - WallpaperSafari<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#82nd-airborne-wallpaper---wallpapersafari>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=http://cdn.wallpapersafari.com/1/69/viOWcd.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse3.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.6PDngxBoqR42AuaUnq5kwAHaDZ&pid=15.1"' alt="82nd Airborne Wallpaper - WallpaperSafari"><p><em>Source: wallpapersafari.com</em></p><blockquote><p>airborne 82nd paratrooper 82d.</p></blockquote><ol start=2><li></li></ol><h2 id=air-assault-wings-fix-bullwinkle>AIR ASSAULT WINGS: FIX BULLWINKLE!<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#air-assault-wings-fix-bullwinkle>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=https://combatreform.org/101staa1.gif onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.3FwwU73lK9ByXpGQ01T6CgHaKr&pid=15.1"' alt="AIR ASSAULT WINGS: FIX BULLWINKLE!"><p><em>Source: combatreform.org</em></p><blockquote><p>assault air 101st airborne wings bullwinkle division combatreform counterinsurgency tactics better.</p></blockquote><p>The Pros and Cons of Butterfly Wallpaper
