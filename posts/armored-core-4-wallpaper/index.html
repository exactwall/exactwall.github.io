In the end, the narrator is successful in driving the woman mad. She becomes so obsessed with the wallpaper that she tears it off the walls in an attempt to free the woman she believes is trapped inside. The final line of the story, “I’ve got out at last,” can be interpreted as either the narrator’s triumph over her own madness or her descent into it.
The color purple has been associated with royalty and wealth for centuries. It’s no wonder, then, that the protagonist of “The Yellow Wallpaper” would be drawn to the purple wallpaper in her room. But what begins as an aesthetic preference quickly turns into an obsession. The wallpaper comes to represent everything that is wrong with her life: her stifling marriage, her lack of autonomy, her mental illness.</p><h2 id=silent-line-armored-core-wallpaper--wallpaper-wide-hd>Silent Line Armored Core Wallpaper | Wallpaper Wide HD<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#silent-line-armored-core-wallpaper--wallpaper-wide-hd>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src=http://cdn4.spong.com/artwork/s/i/silentline172059l/_-Silent-Line-Armored-Core-PS2-_.jpg onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse1.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.109608AyMGsQEKjqHFc_dQHaKd&pid=15.1"' alt="Silent line armored core wallpaper | Wallpaper Wide HD"><p><em>Source: wallpaperwidehd.blogspot.com</em></p><blockquote><p>ps2 minitokyo.</p></blockquote><p>In today&rsquo;s society, it is not uncommon to see teenage girls with walls plastered in pictures of their favorite celebrities or models.

There are several different types of wallpaper, each with its own unique set of benefits and drawbacks.
Faux-masonry wallpaper is the most popular type of wallpaper because it offers a realistic look that can be used in both traditional and modern settings. It&rsquo;s also the least expensive option, making it a good choice for budget-minded homeowners.</p><p>Wallpaper with floral designs is often considered beautiful and elegant, making it perfect for spaces that need to appear elevated but not extravagant. However, this style can be challenging to install because flowers typically require very tight tolerances.</p><p>Linen-textured wallpaper gives a natural look that can be used in any room.

When it comes to choosing wallpaper, there are a few things you need to take into consideration in order to make the best choice for your space. First, you need to decide on the pattern, color and scale of the wallpaper.
The pattern of the wallpaper should be in keeping with the style of your home. If you have a more traditional space, then a damask or floral pattern would be a good choice. For a more modern space, geometric or abstract patterns would work well.</p><p>The color of the wallpaper should complement the existing colors in your home.
