There are many different themes present in &ldquo;The Yellow Wallpaper&rdquo; by Charlotte Perkins Gilman. One theme is that of mental illness and its effects. The narrator is clearly suffering from some sort of mental breakdown, and the story provides a look into how her condition affects her relationships and her view of the world. Another theme is that of sexism and the treatment of women. The narrator&rsquo;s husband is constantly telling her what to do and what not to do, and she is not allowed to pursue any interests of her own. This ultimately leads to her mental breakdown.</p><h2 id=ash-williams-by-paranoidvin-on-deviantart>Ash Williams By Paranoidvin On DeviantArt<a hidden class=anchor aria-hidden=true href=#ash-williams-by-paranoidvin-on-deviantart>#</a></h2><img loading=lazy src="https://images-wixmp-ed30a86b8c4ca887773594c2.wixmp.com/f/7113f477-2e55-489a-a9ff-6aed99429386/dc502ci-c960afe6-9cbd-466e-997a-930dca86dd59.jpg/v1/fill/w_960,h_742,q_75,strp/ash_williams_by_paranoidvin_dc502ci-fullview.jpg?token=eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiJ9.eyJzdWIiOiJ1cm46YXBwOjdlMGQxODg5ODIyNjQzNzNhNWYwZDQxNWVhMGQyNmUwIiwiaXNzIjoidXJuOmFwcDo3ZTBkMTg4OTgyMjY0MzczYTVmMGQ0MTVlYTBkMjZlMCIsIm9iaiI6W1t7ImhlaWdodCI6Ijw9NzQyIiwicGF0aCI6IlwvZlwvNzExM2Y0NzctMmU1NS00ODlhLWE5ZmYtNmFlZDk5NDI5Mzg2XC9kYzUwMmNpLWM5NjBhZmU2LTljYmQtNDY2ZS05OTdhLTkzMGRjYTg2ZGQ1OS5qcGciLCJ3aWR0aCI6Ijw9OTYwIn1dXSwiYXVkIjpbInVybjpzZXJ2aWNlOmltYWdlLm9wZXJhdGlvbnMiXX0.aacyHFqP7lTYcGhaR4GUoOjQRScIyuZOc6M9Uzo_BF0" onerror='this.onerror=null,this.src="https://tse2.mm.bing.net/th?id=OIP.1HifNiL49y1ZRScVU5-dKAHaFu&pid=15.1"' alt="Ash Williams by Paranoidvin on DeviantArt"><p><em>Source: deviantart.com</em></p><blockquote><p>.</p></blockquote><p>Important considerations for screen wallpaper
