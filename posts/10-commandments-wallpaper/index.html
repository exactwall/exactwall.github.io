What is minimalism? In its simplest form, minimalism is the intentional promotion of the things we most value and the removal of everything that distracts us from them.

We only keep things that serve a purpose or bring us joy, and get rid of anything that doesn’t fall into those categories. This decluttering process can be liberating and empowering, as it allows us to focus on what’s truly important to us.\nMinimalism also extends to the food we eat.\n","wordCount":"1929","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2022-02-02T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2022-02-02T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Hunter Lind"},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://exactwall.github.io/posts/10-commandments-wallpaper/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"exactwall","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://exactwall.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://exactwall.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://exactwall.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://exactwall.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://exactwall.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://exactwall.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://exactwall.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>10 Commandments Wallpaper -

Trying to take down a design wallpaper can be a challenging task.

This will ensure that your wall remains stable while you remove the wallpaper.</p></li><li><p>Use caution when moving or cutting any pieces of the wallpaper as they may be fragile and can easily break.

What is minimalism?
In its simplest form, minimalism is the intentional promotion of the things we most value and the removal of everything that distracts us from them. This can be applied to many areas of life, including but not limited to our physical possessions, the food we eat, the way we spend our time, and even the thoughts we think.</p><p>When it comes to our physical possessions, minimalists believe that less is more. We only keep things that serve a purpose or bring us joy, and get rid of anything that doesn’t fall into those categories. This decluttering process can be liberating and empowering, as it allows us to focus on what’s truly important to us.</p><p>Minimalism also extends to the food we eat.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://exactwall.github.io/tags/wallpaper-photos-images/>wallpaper photos images</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://exactwall.github.io/posts/1-corinthians-16-14-wallpaper/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>1 Corinthians 16 14 Wallpaper : Corinthians Lettered</span></a>
