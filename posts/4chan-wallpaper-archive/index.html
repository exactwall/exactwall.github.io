Kawaii culture is characterized by its typically round or heart-shaped facial features, simple and pastel colors, and characteristic anime-inspired graphics. These characteristics arose from a desire among Japanese youth to look cute and stylish. The term “kawaii” was first used in the 1970s to describe Japanese comic books and animation that were aimed at children. At this time, many children in Japan were wearing colorful clothing inspired by these works, which gave rise to the Japanese expression “kawaii ga suki,” meaning “I like it cute.” Kawaii became popularized outside of Japan during the 1990s when people began using it as a way to describe things that are visually pleasing or charming.\n","wordCount":"1794","inLanguage":"en","datePublished":"2021-10-17T00:00:00Z","dateModified":"2021-10-17T00:00:00Z","author":{"@type":"Person","name":"Muriel Turcotte Jr."},"mainEntityOfPage":{"@type":"WebPage","@id":"https://exactwall.github.io/posts/4chan-wallpaper-archive/"},"publisher":{"@type":"Organization","name":"exactwall","logo":{"@type":"ImageObject","url":"https://exactwall.github.io/%3Clink%20/%20abs%20url%3E"}}}</script></head><body id=top><script>localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="dark"?document.body.classList.add("dark"):localStorage.getItem("pref-theme")==="light"?document.body.classList.remove("dark"):window.matchMedia("(prefers-color-scheme: dark)").matches&&document.body.classList.add("dark")</script><header class=header><nav class=nav><div class=logo><a href=https://exactwall.github.io/ accesskey=h title="Home (Alt + H)"><img src=https://exactwall.github.io/apple-touch-icon.png alt aria-label=logo height=35>Home</a><div class=logo-switches><button id=theme-toggle accesskey=t title="(Alt + T)"><svg id="moon" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><path d="M21 12.79A9 9 0 1111.21 3 7 7 0 0021 12.79z"/></svg><svg id="sun" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" width="24" height="18" viewBox="0 0 24 24" fill="none" stroke="currentcolor" stroke-width="2" stroke-linecap="round" stroke-linejoin="round"><circle cx="12" cy="12" r="5"/><line x1="12" y1="1" x2="12" y2="3"/><line x1="12" y1="21" x2="12" y2="23"/><line x1="4.22" y1="4.22" x2="5.64" y2="5.64"/><line x1="18.36" y1="18.36" x2="19.78" y2="19.78"/><line x1="1" y1="12" x2="3" y2="12"/><line x1="21" y1="12" x2="23" y2="12"/><line x1="4.22" y1="19.78" x2="5.64" y2="18.36"/><line x1="18.36" y1="5.64" x2="19.78" y2="4.22"/></svg></button></div></div><ul id=menu><li><a href=https://exactwall.github.io/categories/ title=Categories><span>Categories</span></a></li><li><a href=https://exactwall.github.io/tags/ title=Tags><span>Tags</span></a></li></ul></nav></header><main class=main><article class=post-single><header class=post-header><div class=breadcrumbs><a href=https://exactwall.github.io/>Home</a>&nbsp;»&nbsp;<a href=https://exactwall.github.io/posts/>Posts</a></div><h1 class=post-title>4chan Wallpaper Archive ~ Londonweed.net – Top London &amp;amp; Uk &amp;amp; Ireland &amp;amp; Scotland &amp;amp; Wales Weed From</h1><div class=post-description>Londonweed.net – top london &amp;amp; uk &amp;amp; ireland &amp;amp; scotland &amp;amp; wales weed from</div><div class=post-meta><span title='2021-10-17 00:00:00 +0000 UTC'>October 17, 2021</span>&nbsp;·&nbsp;9 min&nbsp;·&nbsp;1794 words&nbsp;·&nbsp;Muriel Turcotte Jr.</div></header><div class=toc><details open><summary accesskey=c title="(Alt + C)"><span class=details>Table of Contents</span></summary><div class=inner><nav id=TableOfContents><ul><li><a href=#4chan-wallpapers-hd--desktop-and-mobile-backgrounds>4chan Wallpapers HD / Desktop And Mobile Backgrounds</a></li><li><a href=#3840-x-1080-chicago-wallpapers---top-free-3840-x-1080-chicago>3840 X 1080 Chicago Wallpapers - Top Free 3840 X 1080 Chicago</a></li><li><a href=#find-the-fascinating-4chan-wallpaper---marvelous-wallpapers>Find The Fascinating 4chan Wallpaper - Marvelous Wallpapers</a></li><li><a href=#ponies-forever-princess-luna>Ponies Forever: Princess Luna</a></li><li><a href=#ponies-forever-rarity>Ponies Forever: Rarity</a></li><li><a href=#ponies-forever-twilight-sparkle>Ponies Forever: Twilight Sparkle</a></li><li><a href=#600x375px-wallpapers-4chan---wallpapersafari>600x375px Wallpapers 4chan - WallpaperSafari</a></li><li><a href=#londonweednet--top-london-amp-uk-amp-ireland-amp-scotland-amp-wales-weed-from>LondonWeed.Net – Top London & UK & Ireland & Scotland & Wales Weed From</a></li><li><a href=#4chan-1366x768-wallpaper-download>4chan 1366x768 Wallpaper Download</a></li><li><a href=#mobile-4chan-pictures---hq-definition>Mobile 4chan Pictures - HQ Definition</a></li><li><a href=#ponies-forever-big-macintosh>Ponies Forever: Big Macintosh</a></li><li><a href=#4chan-1366x768-wallpaper-download-1>4chan 1366x768 Wallpaper Download</a></li><li><a href=#4chan-hd-wallpaper--background-image--1920x1080>4Chan HD Wallpaper | Background Image | 1920x1080</a></li><li><a href=#wallpapers-4chan-69-images>Wallpapers 4Chan (69+ Images)</a></li></ul></nav></div></details></div><div class=post-content><p>Tips for choosing the perfect wallpaper: Consider your style, environment, and budget.

Kawaii culture originated in Japan, specifically in the cities of Tokyo and Osaka. Kawaii culture is characterized by its typically round or heart-shaped facial features, simple and pastel colors, and characteristic anime-inspired graphics. These characteristics arose from a desire among Japanese youth to look cute and stylish.
The term &ldquo;kawaii&rdquo; was first used in the 1970s to describe Japanese comic books and animation that were aimed at children. At this time, many children in Japan were wearing colorful clothing inspired by these works, which gave rise to the Japanese expression &ldquo;kawaii ga suki,&rdquo; meaning &ldquo;I like it cute.&rdquo; Kawaii became popularized outside of Japan during the 1990s when people began using it as a way to describe things that are visually pleasing or charming.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://exactwall.github.io/tags/wallpaper-photos-images/>wallpaper photos images</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://exactwall.github.io/posts/1967-chevrolet-impala-wallpaper/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>1967 Chevrolet Impala Wallpaper - Impala 1965 Convertible Chevrolet Chevy Ss Classic Muscle Wallpaperup Cars Wallpapers Desktop Lowrider Sign Log</span></a>
