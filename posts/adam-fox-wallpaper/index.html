Texture Wallpaper- What to Look for
When choosing wallpaper, there are a few key things to consider. First and foremost, the texture should be something that works with the décor of your room. For example, if you have a rustic bedroom with wooden furniture, go for a wood grain wallpaper. If you have a more modern bedroom with sleek furniture, choose a textured wallpaper like suede or marble. Secondly, make sure the texture is large enough so that it doesn&rsquo;t look pixelated or chopped up when viewed from a distance. And finally, be sure to factor in how often you&rsquo;ll be changing your wallpaper. A weekly change will give your walls an extra dose of life while monthly changes will keep them looking fresh.
