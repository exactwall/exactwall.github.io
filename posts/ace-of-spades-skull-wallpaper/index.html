Stitch wallpaper is a type of wallcovering that consists of interwoven fabric strips. It was first introduced in the late 17th century and became popular in Europe during the 18th century. The popularity of stitch wallpaper waned in the 19th century, but it experienced a resurgence in the 20th century.
Stitch wallpaper is believed to have originated in England in the late 17th century. At that time, wallcoverings were made from a variety of materials including paper, leather, and fabric. Fabric wallcoverings were usually made by gluing or sewing strips of fabric to a backing material. It is not known for certain how or when the idea of using interwoven fabric strips to create a wallcovering came about, but it is possible that it was inspired by woven tapestries or rugs.</p></div><footer class=post-footer><ul class=post-tags><li><a href=https://exactwall.github.io/tags/wallpaper-photos-images/>wallpaper photos images</a></li></ul><nav class=paginav><a class=prev href=https://exactwall.github.io/posts/3rd-gen-camaro-wallpaper/><span class=title>« Prev</span><br><span>3rd Gen Camaro Wallpaper : Camaro Iroc 1985 Z28 Chevrolet 1990 Wallpapers Chevy 85 Performance 1024 Mailbag Mild Swap Engine Tips Onallcylinders 4k</span></a>
